BOT WILL:

travel to saint anjeka´s shrine
load his skill template
count runs, wins and fails
prepare fast way out if it is the first run or the first run after a failed run
put out his current action
pickup (dragon roots, plant fibers, spiritwood planks, elementalist tomes, lockpicks, gold, all bramble bows, all event items)
travel to guildhall when inventory has less than 6 free slots
buy id kit and identify (all golds)
buy salvage kit and salvage (dragon roots, bramble bows) 
sell (all golds except the checked item types)
store (full stacks of plant fibers and spiritwood planks, checked item types, all gold when he is done)
then he will continue 


BOT WILL NOT: 

work with a different GWA2, the one used was adapted
work as A/R (this just sucks, is way slower and does not work properly, since my version does not use winnowing)
store random items in your inventory, he will either sell them or just keep them
store event items
he might sometimes not count fails and / or runs at all, when beeing stuck at the balling step (does not happen too often)


ALSO NOTICE:

factions only is slower and has a higher fail rate (all campaings somewhat close to 1 fail every 50-100 runs, factions only 1 fail every ~50 runs)
look at the screen to get an impression of speed / fail rate
again: will not work with a different GWA2, the one used was adapted
